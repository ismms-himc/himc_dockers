This helps build a jupyter-based data science environment for R + Python.
This image will include more experimental and external dependency than
`rpy2/jupyter-ubuntu`, such as:

- IDE-like autocompletion for R (https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lsp)

The naming convention for the base image is the one used in the documentation for the
base rpy2 image (see its [README](../base/README.md)).

## Run (using automated build)

To run the latest (most recent rpy2/ubuntu of the builds), simply do

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 rpy2/jupyter_ds-ubuntu
```

## Build

```bash
docker build -t rpy2/jupyter_ds-ubuntu:master-default .
```

As with the base image, the ubuntu release and rpy2 version can be specified at
build time (again, see the documentation for the base image).

Note that Ubuntu releases older than 20.04 are no longer supported.

```bash
RPY2_VERSION=3.2.5
UBUNTU_RELEASE=20.04
docker build -t rpy2/jupyter_ds-ubuntu:"${RPY2_VERSION}"-default \
  --build-arg RPY2_VERSION="${RPY2_VERSION}" \
  --build-arg UBUNTU_RELEASE="${UBUNTU_RELEASE}" .
```
